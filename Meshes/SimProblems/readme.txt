ElTopo halved the time step too many times for these meshes, in a way
it did not have progress to step from V0 to V1.

File description:
0) V0_prob27_209: initial mesh V0 with the 209 first vertices
corresponding to fine mesh vertices (infinite mass vertices)
1) V1_prob27_209: final mesh V1 with the 209 first vertices
corresponding to fine mesh vertices (infinite mass vertices)
