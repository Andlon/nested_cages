\section{Results and applications}
\label{sec:results}

We implemented a prototype of our method as a serial \textsc{Matlab} program
%
We report timings of our unoptimized code for a few representative examples in
\reftab{timings}.
%
As expected the bottleneck is the collision-free re-inflation step.
%
We experimented with a wide variety of shapes, ranging from CAD models,
characters, and scanned objects (see \reffig{zoo}). By default we compute
layers so that each coarser layer has $2^{-\frac{2}{3}}\times$ as many facets as
the previous finer layer. This ratio is chosen so that a resulting tetrahedral
mesh of the volume will have approximately $8\times$ fewer elements. For most
meshes we compute seven layers, with fewer for lower resolution inputs.
%
In our supplemental material, we attach all input models, corresponding output
cages, and a small program to visualize slices through the cages.

\input{timings_table}

Our method is agnostic to the decimator used to create the input meshes
$\Minp_1,\dots,\Minp_k$. In this way we inherit the feature set of the
decimator. 
%
\reffig{decimations}
compares using the regular mesh inducing decimator in \cite{cgal} (default for
all our other examples) and the feature-adaptive decimator of \cite{openmesh}.
% Meshfix is mentioned at beginning of method.tex

%  On the other hand, minimizing surface ARAP (right) preserves the mesh
%  quality of the initial (non-regular) decimation but leads to extra volume.}
%  \label{fig:energies}
%\end{figure}

To test the robustness of our method with respect to noise in the input model,
we compare computing seven nested cages on the \emph{Bunny} and the same model
corrupted with noise in the normal direction (see \reffig{noisy-bunny}). The
resulting layers tightly hug both shapes, producing similar outermost cages.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/noisy-bunny}
  \caption{Noise add in the normal direction to the input bunny does not
  affect our ability to generate seven quality outer layers.}
  \label{fig:noisy-bunny}
\end{figure}

We also conducted stress tests to evaluate how well our method scales with the
number of layers. We nest 25 tightly fitting layers around the \emph{Horse} in
\reffig{horse-25-layers} and 50 around \emph{Max Planck} in \reffig{zoo}.

%
Constructing our nested cages can be considered expensive \emph{precomputation}
for a multiresolution linear system solver.
%
However, once meshes are computed the multigrid solver is sleek and memory
efficient.
%
A single multiresolution V-cycle for a Poisson equation with homogeneous
Dirichlet boundary conditions inside the volume of the \emph{Octopus} with over
seven million vertices, takes 1.4 seconds using 2GB max memory. With 14 more
V-cycles the solution converges for a total time of 21 seconds (see
\reffig{octopus-poisson}).
%
In contrast, \textsc{Matlab}'s backslash operator thrashes when using over 22GB
of memory finishing in over 16 minutes.
%
\textsc{Cholmod}'s Cholesky factorization with reordering is mildly better than
\textsc{Matlab}, solving via backsubstitution in 10 minutes, but suffers from
similar memory issues during the pre-factorization procedures, which takes over
an hour using 17GB max memory.
%
In terms of precomputation, our time consuming cage computation lives at a much
earlier stage than pre-factorization: before determining constraints or
boundary conditions and before even choosing the particular system being
solved.


\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/octopus-poisson}
  \caption{A single multiresolution v-cycle takes 1.4 secs on this 7M-vertex
  volumetric Poisson equation in the \emph{Octopus}. With 14 more iterations
  (21 secs) the residual error matches a direct solver's (11 mins, back
  substitution only).}

%
As we do not alter the core iterative nature of multiresolution, we benefit
from its flexibility. For example, we may quickly change the diffusion rate in
a heat equation solved in the volume of the \emph{Pelvis} (see
\reffig{pelvis-diffusion}). 
%
Factorization based solvers, in general scrap previous precomputation after
such a global change to the system matrix. 
%
Multiresolution hardly notices and may even use previous solutions as a warm
start if changes to the system are slight.
%
In this example, we employ Neumann boundary conditions and notice that naively
decimating the input mesh leads to a divergent solver (inset).

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/pelvis-diffusion}
  \caption{We solve a diffusion equation $(λ∆+I) x = b$ for various diffusion
  rates $λ$ with our nested cages in a multiresolution solver (top: surface
  values via Neumann boundary conditions, bottom: slice through tet-mesh
  volume).}
  \label{fig:pelvis-diffusion}
\end{figure}

On less challenging domains, naive decimations can be used, but may require
many relaxation (a.k.a.\ smoothing) iterations on each level of each v-cycle.
%
In \reffig{armadillo-heat-plot}, we compute smooth geodesics via two Poisson
equations in the volume of the \emph{Armadillo} \cite{Crane:2013:RFV}.
%
Using our nested cages, the multiresolution solver converges independent of the
number of relaxation iterations used (typically fewer relaxation iterations and
more v-cycles is preferable).
%
In contrast, multiresolution using naive non-nested decimations converge when
using a large number of relaxation iterations, and then at a rate equivalent to
single relaxation iteration with our meshes.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/armadillo-heat-plot}
  \caption{We solve for smooth geodesics via two Poisson equations over a
  tetrahedal mesh of the \emph{Armadillo}. Multiresolution using naive
  overlapping and shrinking decimations leads to divergence unless a very large
  number of relaxation iterations is used in each level in each v-cycle. Ours
  is always convergent.}

\end{figure}

A single enclosing cage is useful for creating a lower dimensional volumetric
domain for elastic simulations of input models that are either too high
resolution or complicated by meshing imperfections \cite{Xu:2014:SDF}.
%
In \reffig{frankenstein}, we compare to extracting the outer hull of the
multi-component and self-intersecting \emph{Frankenstein} using
\cite{Jacobson:WN:2013}.
%
While technically a ``perfect fit'' in terms of tightness, this cage fails to
coarsen the domain and meshing near intersection creates sliver triangles
problematic for numerical simulations.
%
We also compare to contouring the signed distance field \cite{Xu:2014:SDF},
this produces a coarse manifold mesh, but its loose fit joins the legs near the
knees.
%
With the same vertex count, our cage is a tight fit making it especially
suitable for elastic simulation with collision detection and response.
%
The deformation of the volume inside the coarse cage is then propagated via
linear interpolation to the embedded mesh.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/frankenstein-physics}
  \caption{Extracting an outer hull with \protect\cite{Jacobson:WN:2013} fails
  to coarsen the domain away from the original discretization (top left). Contouring
  the signed distance field \protect\cite{Xu:2014:SDF} achieves true nesting at
  a large iso-level fusing the legs (top center). Our method fits the input
  tightly (top right). The coarse mesh provides a low-dimensional domain for
  real-time physical simulation (middle) and simple interpolation onto the
  input mesh (bottom).}

\alec{INSERT COLLISION DETECTION RESULT}

A single very coarse cage is needed for interactive deformation with
generalized barycentric coordinates or other ``cage-based'' methods.
%
In \reffig{dane-vs-ben-chen}, we compare to the automatic cage creation
heuristic in \cite{Ben-Chen:2009:SDT} and see much tighter fits for the same
vertex counts.

The ability to customize our optimization energy enables not just better cages,
but better generalized barycentric coordinates. In particular, harmonic
coordinates are theoretically defined for arbitrary polyhedra, yet previous
works implement them inside triangle-mesh cages \cite{HarmonicCoodinates07}.
%
To utilize popular quad-dominant meshes as cages, all faces must be outside the
input model and \emph{planar}.
%
Such cages are difficult to model manually, hence simply triangulating any
high-order facets \cite{HarmonicCoodinates07}.
%
We complement the recent sketch-based quad-meshing tool \cite{Takayama:2013},
post-processing its output to enclose the input model and minimize a
planarization energy \cite{poranne2013interactive}.
%
Quad-dominant cages are easier to control as their visualization is less
cluttered (see \reffig{hand-hc}).
%
More importantly, harmonic coordinates constructed (via their recursive
definition) on the planar-quad polyhedron are also higher quality: coordinates
are smooth functions inside each quad.
%
In contrast, coordinates of a triangulated cage would depend heavily on the
choice of diagonals used in each quad.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/hand-hc}
  \caption{Left to right: a quad mesh is quickly sketched atop the \emph{Hand}
  and our pipeline moves it outside the input while planarizing quads. A
  cage-based deformation is applied via harmonic coordinates computed over the
  volume inside the planar-quad polyhedron (a few coordinates visualized in
  pseudocolor). These weights are smooth inside each quad. In contrast,
  triangulating the quads would lead to non-smooth, meshing-dependent values in
  each quad (two alternative triangulations).}
  \label{fig:hand-hc}
\end{figure}

In \reffig{swat-cage}, we again adapt the optimization energy, this time to
maintain the reflectional symmetry of the coarse input cage.
%
The input \emph{S.W.A.T.\ man} mesh is riddled with meshing artifacts, but we
may still flow it inside the coarse mesh.
%
When re-inflating, the asymmetric details of expanding input mesh are corrected
by adding an energy term to encourage maintaining symmetry.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/swat-cage}
  \caption{The \emph{S.W.A.T. man} is an artifact-ridden mesh with 2806 pairs
  of intersecting triangles, 24 non-manifold edges, 51 boundary loops and 51
  connected components. Our shrinking flow is robust to such artifacts. Once
  inside the coarse, overlapping input cage, we re-inflate it and produce a
  fully exterior cage used to deform the embedded model.}
