\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Needs figures made:}
- Zoo:
  - anchor
  - arma
  - bunny
  - gargo
  - Model1
  - Model3
  - Model6
  - Model7
  - Model9
  - pelvis
  - octopus
- couplingdown comparison of decimators
- rampant stress test with small number of layers vs CGAL
 

- rampant 100 layers
- beast symmetry (+arap) cage
- Kenshi's hand: just triangle mesh using arap energy
- Kenshi's hand: planarization energy 
- Kenshi's hand: compute HC and make cage-based deformation
- fill in timings table
- Model4: generate our results to match cgal's
- regenerate octopus
- didactic 2D figures
  - flow
  - expansion
- horse redo with ARAP energy
- download chang xi's ball mesh sequence
- cartoon heart
- left atrium
- failure case for simpler flows: mean curvature flow on fine mesh does not
  go inside coarse mesh, may even intersect itself
    - pelvis or rampant failing to go inside at all
    - octopus flowing inside but shrinking too much and puts parts in wrong
      place
    - or 2d flow

- xyz-dragon High resolution stress test
- alec: implement multigrid
  - Multigrid Poisson equation. Show that naive non-nested meshes will have
    poor/no convergence: alligator teeth, etc.
      - generic poisson equation in 2d and in 3d
        - compare to level set decimation
        - compare to qslim
      - geodesics in heat 
  - Multires automatic skinning weights (i.e. QP solve). See Baohua Wu's thesis.
  - Multi-res ARAP deformation/physical elastics
  - Bijective mapping (Locally injective mapping of tet mesh conforming to all
    layers): maintains nesting.
- bunny: add random noise to initial model and run pipeline

- flow Model3 (human) inside and inflate Model4 (armour)
- buddha using open flipper decimation
- propagate cages along animation sequence (just re-inflation)
- cage transfer: transfer horse cage to giraffe
