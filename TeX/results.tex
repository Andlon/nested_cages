  \caption{Methods like \protect\cite{Ben-Chen:2009:SDT} use coarse cages a
  computational workhorses to reduce complexity. Their iterative offset
  heuristic produces oversmoothed, loosely fitting cages.}

  \caption{The \emph{S.W.A.T. man} is an artifact-ridden mesh with 2806 pairs
  of intersecting triangles, 24 non-manifold edges, 51 boundary loops and 51
  connected components. Our shrinking flow to the input overlapping coarse cage
  is robust to such artifacts. Once inside, we re-inflate and produce a fully
  exterior cage.}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/warrior-poisson-vs-cgal}
  \caption{Contouring a shape's distance field requires aggressive spacing
  between isolevels to produce valid nesting. Semantically distant parts
  \emph{fuse} together, destroying the shape-awareness of the volumetric
  Laplacian.}

  \caption{Our tight nesting property is robust even when the number of layers
  is large.}

  layers, and outermost, coarsest layer.}

\subsection{Needs figures made:}
- Zoo:
  - anchor
  - arma
  - bunny
  - gargo
  - Model1
  - Model3
  - Model6
  - Model7
  - Model9
  - pelvis
  - octopus
  - horse
- couplingdown comparison of decimators
- rampant stress test with small number of layers vs CGAL
- cgal iso surface generation comparison vs CGAL
- Plain decimation creating bad overlaps
- kenshi's hand


- failure case for simpler flows: mean curvature flow on fine mesh does not
  go inside coarse mesh, may even intersect itself
    - pelvis or rampant failing to go inside at all
    - octopus flowing inside but shrinking too much and puts parts in wrong
      place
    - or 2d flow
- voxelize to get containing shell--> decimate --> run our pipeline to force
  outside: use for volumetric calculations: This has the benefit that the
  containing mesh is nice quality (cf. \cite{Jacobson:WN:2013}) and tightly
  fitting (cf. \cite{Xu:2014:SDF}).
- didactic 2D figures
  - flow
  - expansion
- rampant 100 layers
+ swat symmetry cage
+ Kenshi's hand: planarization energy + arap
- Kenshi's hand: compute HC and make cage-based deformation

- comparison of volumetric arap, surface arap, volume
- bunny: add random noise to initial model and run pipeline
  - rerun with higher resolution
- xyz-dragon High resolution stress test
+ alec: implement multigrid
  + Multigrid Poisson equation. Show that naive non-nested meshes will have
    poor/no convergence: alligator teeth, etc.
      - generic poisson equation in 2d and in 3d
        + compare to level set decimation
        + compare to qslim
      - geodesics in heat 
  - Multires automatic skinning weights (i.e. QP solve). See Baohua Wu's thesis.
  - Multi-res ARAP deformation/physical elastics
  - Bijective mapping (Locally injective mapping of tet mesh conforming to all
    layers): maintains nesting.
- beast for zoo

- cartoon heart
- left atrium
- flow Model3 (human) inside and inflate Model4 (armour)
- buddha using open flipper decimation
- propagate cages along animation sequence (just re-inflation)
- cage transfer: transfer horse cage to giraffe

\alec{discuss how we chose our default decimation ratio}
