\label{sec:results}

Stress tests
  1) Very large number of layers: 100!
  2) Insanely complex fractal-like shape with very close features and many holes

Multigrid Poisson equation. Show that naive non-nested meshes will have
poor/no convergence: alligator teeth, etc.
  - generic poisson equation in 2d and in 3d
    - compare to level set decimation
    - compare to qslim
  - geodesics in heat 

Multi-res ARAP deformation/physical elastics

Literally design and 3D-print a matryoshka doll. Admittedly there's an extra
constraint we're not considering which is that the nested halves need to be
removable from each other.

Collision detection, penetration depth estimation. Unlike AABB or KDOP, cages
are isometry invariant (although so are OABB).
  - cache distance to fine mesh on coarse mesh, then approximate distance to
    fine mesh by finding closest point on coarse mesh and adding fine mesh
    distance. Why need nested then?

Multigrid fluid simulation. Topology is important.
  - medical example: e.g. heart, naive multires combined two unrelated veins
  - ask fang.

Multires automatic skinning weights (i.e. QP solve). See Baohua Wu's thesis.

Adaptive simulation \cite{Debunne:2001:DRD}

Conservative design with contacts in mind: if I'm designing a mechanical object
I want to be sure that two parts don't interpenetrate each other. Suppose the
shapes were super high-res, then design could be slow, so swap in our nested
meshes as a sort of Level-of-detail hierarchy. I guess this only makes sense
for the static (or at least rigid) objects in the design.

Dynamic update: how much work is it to deform the fine mesh and have the coarse
meshes follow? No need for the flow since we already have a feasible initial
position. Just ``simulation'' at this point?

Zoo of results: at least 20 models.

Automatic cages for deformation. Symmetry preservation.

Bijective mapping (Locally injective mapping of tet mesh conforming to all
layers): maintains nesting.
