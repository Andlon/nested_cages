Decimation

Non-nested decimation \cite{Garland:1997:SSU}

Planar decimation avoiding flips (and therefor also self-intersections) in
output \cite{AnderssonGL09}.  \cite{gumhold2003intersection} new coarse mesh
won't contain self-intersections, but not trying to avoid intersections with
original fine mesh.

Rather than work against the mountain of advances in shape decimation we
complement them. Our method takes as input an arbitrary decimation and works as
a post process to nest each layer.

Cage generation

Offset surfaces 

\cite{Campen:2010} Exact offset surface of triangle mesh is a curved surface
and only approximated by a fine mesh.  Could generalized 2d offset method
\cite{chen2005polygon} to 3D \cite{Jacobson:WN:2013}.  Or just mesh signed
distance field directions (e.g.\ using \cite{cgal}). Can be made robust to
nasty input with \cite{Xu:2014:SDF} and used for creating low res tet mesh for
simulation.
%
But offsets are bad idea for creating coarse mesh: too fine OR lose nesting
guarantee OR too far away (and start to combine features)

\cite{Shen:2004:IAI}, as an application, iteratively refine a MLS surface to
enclose an existing model: search for global parameter to minimize distance
indirectly. Presented algorithm determines if level-set is outside, but
contouring could still "slice" into original surface.  Further, topological
control is lost and close features are still quickly merged. 

Multi-grid 

\cite{McAdams:2011} Finite difference multigrid on voxelized input. Why not
voxelize? Glue geodesically distant parts together: voxel size determined by
min feature size and min void size. What about duplicated cells? Is there a
citation for this? Boundary handling overwhelms advantages of regular grid. Is
this even always well-defined? Nice if we had a counterexample.
\cite{Sykora09} replicates lattice cells in 2d, not sure how this affects his
shape-matching-style ARAP optimization.

\cite{wojtan2011liquid} fluid sims often couple Eulerian (finite difference)
grids with tracked surfaces. Seems that Wojtan et.\ al will identify grid cells
containing more than one distant surfaces and perform \emph{surgery on the
surface} rather than duplicate grid cells.

\cite{Adams:1999:PMS} Ritz-Galerkin multigrid, actually this is a mesh
decimation paper for creating ``node-nested'' tet meshes, building on
\cite{guillard1993}. Select subset of nodes, try to connect in a reasonable,
Delaunay-ish way. Simple linear restriction operator.

\cite{fish1995efficient} just an example of a (nonlinear) multigrid solver
which expects the user to provide (nested?) tetrahedral meshes as input.

\cite{feng1997non} more complicated restriction operator for Galerkin multigrid
on non-nested meshes, though it seems it's expected that the surfaces of each
mesh coincide: user provides meshes. I'm not sure how much better this
restriction would really be compared to simple barycentric one.

\cite{Debunne:2001:DRD} 
Adaptive simulations for visco-elastic solids. Computes a hierarchy of
non-nested decimations (QSlim \cite{Garland:1997:SSU}), tethers fine mesh
points to \emph{closest} coarse vertex.

Flows
\cite{Kazhdan2012} remove singularities, also self-intersections
\cite{Sacht:SIV:2013}, in general, will not move inside original surface

Alternating global scaling and attraction, attempts to move inside. No
guarantees, requires parameter tuning \cite{Wang:2008}

\cite{Tagliasacchi:2012:MCS} coerces flow toward the medial axis
