\section*{Appendix: Flow counterexample}
%
\label{app:counterexample}
%
There exist polyhedra that cannot be continuously flowed inside itself.
%
Consider the surface constructed in \reffig{vouga-fan}, right. Though inward
pointing normals can be defined at all vertices, any non-negative (even
infinitesimal) inward movement of the vertices will introduce ``edge-edge''
collisions with the original surface.

\caption{Take every other vertex around the star surface on the left and
rotate it about the origin to create the ``origami pinwheel'' on the right.
Vertices of this new surface cannot be continuously flowed inward without
creating intersections with the original surface.}
