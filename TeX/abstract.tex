Many tasks in geometry processing and physical simulation benefit from
multiresolution hierarchies. The coarse
approximations must satisfy several desiderata, in order for the
multiresolution algorithms to be efficient and accurate: the coarsened object
should respect the topology of the original, it should \emph{enclose} the
original object, yet should fit the original as tightly as possible, i.e.
include a minimal amount of extraneous volume. Existing techniques for building
a multiresolution hierarchy, such as tracing distance level sets of the object,
voxelizing the object, or meshing the object followed by decimation, violate
one or more of these desiderata. We propose a solution that satisfies all three
requirements by successively constructing each next-coarsest level of the hierarchy, 
using a sequence of decimation, flow, and contact-aware physical simulation steps. 
From coarse to fine, each layer then fully encloses the next while
retaining a snug fit and respecting the original surface topology. We show that the method 
is applicable to a wide variety of shapes of complex geometry and topology, and demonstrate
applicability of the hierarchy to geometric modeling and multigrid simulation.
