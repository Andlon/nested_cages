%
Many tasks in geometry processing and physical simulation benefit from
multiresolution hierarchies.
%
One important characteristic across a variety of applications is that coarser
layers strictly \emph{encage} finer layers, nesting one another.
%
Existing techniques such as surface mesh decimation, voxelization, or
contouring distance level sets do not provide sufficient control over the
\emph{quality} of the output surfaces while maintaining strict nesting.
%
We propose a solution that enables use of application-specific decimation and
quality metric.
%
The method constructs each next-coarsest level of the hierarchy, using a
sequence of decimation, flow, and contact-aware optimization steps.
%
From coarse to fine, each layer then fully encages the next while retaining a
snug \newhl{fit.
%\ignore{and respecting the original surface topology}
We} show that the method is applicable to a wide variety of shapes of complex
geometry and topology.
%
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our nested cages not only for
multiresolution solvers, but also for conservative collision detection, domain
discretization for elastic simulation, and cage-based geometric modeling.
