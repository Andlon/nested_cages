Many tasks in geometry processing and physical simulation benefit from
multiresolution hierarchies. Ideal coarse domain approximations should satisfy
several desiderata for efficient and accurate multiresolution algorithms: the
coarsened domain should respect the original topology, \emph{enclose} the
original object, yet fit as tightly as possible.
%
Existing techniques such as surface mesh decimation, voxelization, or
contouring distance level sets, violate one or more of these desiderata.
%
We propose a solution that satisfies all three requirements by successively
constructing each next-coarsest level of the hierarchy, using a sequence of
decimation, flow, and contact-aware optimization steps.
%
From coarse to fine, each layer then fully encages the next while retaining a
snug fit and respecting the original surface topology.
%
We show that the method is applicable to a wide variety of shapes of complex
geometry and topology.
%
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our nested cages not only for
multiresolution solvers, but also for conservative collision detection, domain
discretization for elastic simulation, and cage-based geometric modeling.
